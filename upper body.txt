Saturday, September 26: 12 Students came to begin work on projects. Students began to consider what type of projects are interesting to them. We have students who are designing robots using Lego Mindstorm, coding in HTML, Java and Scratch and designing using AutoDesk Inventor. Students are looking forward to the Raspberry Pis being available.
